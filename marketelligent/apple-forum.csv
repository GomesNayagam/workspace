https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6079080	App will not stop loading	I was playing a game (Pocket Frogs) on my iPad mini when an ad for another game app (Skyburger) popped up. I wanted to touch the 'x' to close the screen but accidentally touched on the screen and Skyburger started loading.  The problem is that it won't stop loading and, strangely, Pocket Frogs is still visible underneath the loading page.  I can't get back to Pocket Frogs or stop Skyburger from loading. It's stuck on a black & white "Loading" bar with Pocket Frogs visible (but not accessible) underneath the black background behind the loading bar.   How can I get this app to stop loading so that I can access Pocket Frogs again?   Thanks!

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6065452	How to stop iPad from transferring apps to Mac?	First off, let me state that I have iCloud backups of the most important app data and I don't care that I don't have backups for the rest. I don't care that those apps might one day be gone from the App Store. I don't care about saving my game data.   What I do care about is that I shouldn't be forced to have a backup of ALL the apps on my iPad/iPhone on my MBP, which didn't come with unlimited storage space.   I think at one point I was asked by iTunes if I wanted to transfer the purchases to my Mac (or if I wanted to backup the apps? I don't remember) and I foolishly clicked yes. Now, even though I have clicked on "Rest Warnings" multiple times, iTunes still insists on copying all the apps to my Mac without asking me if I wanna do it.   I saw some suggestions about creating empty folders and stuff but I don't wanna do that. It just doesn't make sense that Apple doesn't give us an option to NOT backup our apps to our Macs. I thought the point of having an App Store where you can download your purchases anytime you want is so that you don't have to keep everything on your Mac.   Any help is greatly appreciated!     Keywords: how to stop iPad from copying apps to Mac, how to stop iPad from backing up apps to computer, how to prevent iPad from syncing apps	Sun Apr 06 16:53:05 IST 2014

I don't want to restore settings since I'm not sure weather it will interfere with my apps or games.   I see a lot of people having similar problems but with no fixes, also other people seem to have more of the 'waiting' problem, mine do not even begin to update.   Does anyone know what this could be?

https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-5451	How to update iOS on your Apple Device.	What is iOS?  iOS or iPhone Operating System is the software that runs on your iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch and makes it work the way it does.    Every so often Apple updates this software and you can then download and apply it to your device if it is supported by it.   To Find out what version of iOS you are currently running, on your device, go to Settings->General->About->Version   There are 2 ways to update iOS:   1. Using a computer that is running iTunes.   2. In the device itself using your Wifi connection. This is commonly known as Over The Air Updates. To be able to perform the update over the air, you need to be running at least iOS version 5. If you are not running at least iOS5 then the Software Update button under Settings will not be there, and you will need to to update by connecting to a computer running iTunes.   The following Article explains step by step what needs to be done in both cases.   iOS: How to update your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4623     If you don't have the Software Update button under settings scroll down to the section titled Update your device using iTunes     *NOTE:  If you are not a Developer do not Update to Beta versions of iOS. If you do update to a Beta version and are not a certified developer as established by Apple, you forfeit any support from Apple and these forums.   *NOTE 2: If you are a Developer do not post Bug issues with Beta versions of iOS in the user forums. You need to post in the Private Developer Forums.	Tue Jun 18 20:07:19 IST 2013

Short of cleaning up your iPad of excess data stored on it, there is one method the Genius Bar recommended that works very well.   The Location Services setting on the Settings App if turned on, will run in the background without any notification in the active Apps taskbar. If you disable Location Services it can free up a lot of space for most applications to run without issue.  So unless you need Location Services on for specific mapping needs, turning it off can solve most quitting issues.    Any other solutions people are welcome to comment or edit this tip.

https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-4832	Macs that support iPads	Before October 23, 2012, all iPads supported a minimum of Mac OS X 10.5.8 for connectivity and iTunes 10.6.3. This meant they could hook up to G4s and G5s that have USB 2 and Firewire, as long as 10.5.8 was installed on them.       Starting September 2003, G4s and G5s came with USB 2.  ﻿USB 1.1 available in older Macs only transfers data at 15 Mbps when nothing else transfers data, and frequently the USB 2 cards available did not have enough power to power the iPad when connected.  10.5 can be updated free to 10.5.8.  For more on upgrading to 10.5.8, see this  user tip.   Generation 1.0 iPad is compatible with Mac OS X 10.4.11 and PowerPCs that don't have the minimum 867 Mhz on a single processor, if the USB 2 card supported them.  Generation 1.0 iPad can't be updated past iOS 5.1.1.   At this point the other main difference between Generation 2 and Generation 1 iPads, is the addition of the camera, and the preinstalled iOS of 4.2.1. iPad 2 and later can all be upgraded to iOS 7.    Starting with the October 23, 2012 release (generation 4 and iPad Mini), iPads required a minimum of Mac OS X 10.6, thus making PowerPC Macs not able to connect to them. ﻿iPad 4th generation came with iOS 6.   iPad Mini came with iOS 6.   Part of the confusion about compatibility is that iPad 2 and later can have iOS 7 or iOS 6 installed on them.   Whether you can downgrade to an older iOS is unknown, but may be essential if you end up getting an iPad that has already been upgraded past the top iOS 5.  Be sure if PowerPC compatibility of any sort is essential, you get those answers first before you buy a model with a newer iOS.   If you aren't running a minimum of Mac OS X 10.4 on your Mac, you'll have to buy 10.4 or to get 10.4.11 for the iPad 1, or Mac OS X 10.5 for iPad 2 and 3 as that can get you up to 10.5.8 free.   10.6 can be installed directly on a 10.4.4 or later on an Intel Mac, as long as you buy the retail Installer CD, and have a minimum of 1 GB of RAM.     For more on upgrading to 10.6, see this user tip.  The source of this data on ipad compatibility comes from Wikipedia.   For more on iDevice compatibility with Mac OS X versions, see this tip.

https://discussions.apple.com/docs/DOC-4072	Steps to prevent theft of Apple products	Hello and welcome to my User Tip     "iCrime" is on the rise, also called "Apple picking" and other names.   Safety Messages from the SFMTA and the San Francisco Police Department Personal safety   The SFPD has identified a recent trend of electronic devices robberies on Muni. Passengers   using iPhones and laptop computers on Muni vehicles are being targeted.   Also being targeted are people using these devices while waiting for   Muni vehicles at Muni coach stops, bus shelters, and light rail vehicle   platforms. Passengers are reminded to   be aware of their surroundings while traveling on Muni. Suspects prey on   victims using these devices knowing they are distracted while texting   or listening to music on PDAs, using laptops, and talking on cellular   phones. Passengers should be careful to limit the use of these devices   and always be aware of other passengers on the vehicle.   How big is the iCrime wave? National data aren't available, but in New York, there were more than 26,000 incidents of electronics theft in the first 10 months of 2011—81% involving mobile phones—according to an internal police-department document. In Washington, D.C., cellphone-related robberies jumped 54% from 2007 to 2011, according to the Metropolitan Police Department.     I'm going to explain some street smart criminal thinking and how best you can avoid becoming a victim of crime with your Apple products.   The criminal mind is mostly basically motivated by the need to acquire items of value to either sustain themselves and/or their drug habit. Some criminals commit crimes for the sheer thrill of it as it makes them feel alive. Some do it to people they know because they don't like them or as a form of psychological warfare.   Some do it because they are very young kids and don't know any better yet or don't have the concept of private property learned yet. Some societies in island nations I have visited are like that, anyone can just borrow anything of anyone's at any time because it's a very small community and they share everything anyway and always work together in groups to acquire food or work on a project.   Most crimes are crimes of opportunity, the criminal, like a hunter, is always on the lookout to gain a monetary advantage. You can usually tell some of these kind of people, they have very little attributes that would make them a ideal candidate for employment and advancement, either by their looks, their age, or their dress or how they carry themselves. However some people act like that sometimes and other times hold down a perfectly respectable job, changing roles as needed or just out with friends for a night on the town. The objective is to mentally gauge if the person(s) are desperate enough to perform criminal activity or not, not what they wear or how they act exclusively.     Apple products are considered luxury items   They have great return value for the work involved acquiring them illegally. They are also highly ascetically pleasing, this often motivates the impulsive emotional based criminal who wants to have "oh shiny" to themselves because they otherwise can't afford it or don't want to separate with the cash even if they do have it, finding stealing it a much better option.   Some people just have a aversion with parting with money in large amounts, so they steal instead.     Crime is usually taking advantage of a opportunity, if you reduce the opportunity, you reduce the potential of crime.       So how do you reduce yourself from becoming a "mark" for theft, burglary or robbery of your Apple products?   You don't let people you don't know, know about your valuables or your security procedures.   You don't make something of value easier for someone to take, even if you do know them.   You reduce the time it takes to take valuable items and cause the persons trying to take them unexpected delays and increase their chances of being caught.   When you trust others, it shouldn't be given lightly, but earned gradually over time in increasing amounts.   Don't assume just because you think something couldn't occur, doesn't mean it won't.       Don't flash  your expensive or desirable Apple product unless in locations you know it's safe to do so.   For instance you don't use your $3500 MacBook Pro in a coffee shop surrounded by people using $400 Window PC laptops. If you do, you cover the logo or dress down the machine as not to advertise your rich or superior or better than others that may motivate a theft or a accidental drink spill on your keyboard which will fry it in seconds.   You certainly don't leave the machine unattended to grab something or head to the restroom unless there is a lock on it to prevent a snatch and grab by some thief who can run away faster than you can catch them, and even if you do likely damage the machine in the process.   I'm sure it's quite illegal in nearly all business locations to lock the doors, in the case of fire or other panic, so basically you can't leave something of value unattended.     Don't wear the signature white Apple earbud headphones of iPods, iPhones etc., in areas that tell the criminal you have a pricey Apple device in your pocket, only in environments where you know your safe to do so.   Use a black case cover to hide the shiny metal signature back of a iPod or iPhone so it looks like any ordinary crap phone.   Use black headphone cables, even those cheap looking over the head ones, in public places where you could become a victim of crime. If your in such a location you shouldn't use anything that advertises you have anything of value, even if it's only worth $5. Crackheads will steal or rob even items of small value amounts items to support their habit.       While your sizing up the potential threats around you   The criminal hunter is also sizing you up for potential for attack and profit. They will gauge your behavior, and your clothing, your hair cut, the roughness of your hands, even your tan level to try to figure out what you are so as to see if they can frighten you or make you act in a response method they are familiar what the outcome would be or assess your personality and their chances of success.   They also want to know if it's worth the effort too, people who are wealthy usually carry only credit cards, however if they are carrying a iPhone and/or a nice watch or jewelry, then would make a inviting target. The very poor are not worthy targets, the young middle class worker may be prime as they tend to carry cash more often than not and not established credit yet to have cards.   The criminal is looking for cash or items they can quickly sell for profit at the local drug dealer or fence, this could even include expensive liquors one buys at a local store, which is highly sought after by fences as it's consumed and the evidence is then gone from memory. Tide laundry detergent is a another highly sought after item because say a dozen bottles gets the crackhead a $5 rock, the fence can sell the Tide to the poor masses for a profit. Some of the Tide actually winds up back on the stores shelves again as crony store owners buy the stolen goods cheaper than they can wholesale.   Criminals may beg you for a dollar to see your cash ("sorry I only carry credit cards" or "I used the last dollar in the store there"). They may pretend to be a Apple fan to get you to take out your precious. Some may pull the trick where they motion to you to lower your head phone volume, even though they can't hear it, just so you take it out or sheepishly comply with their illogical order to test your resolve.   If you see something isn't right, you should take the headphones off as to have all your senses on alert and start slowly placing some distance between you and the other, but not in a manner that conveys  fear, just act like this is your next stop or other normal behavior, but your actually trying to get around others for protection or better your physical position to defend against a attack.    Do not eyeball a challenger or deranged person directly (which is challenging or conveys fear depending how you hold your eyes), or turn your back to them (which conveys disrespect or contempt and also makes you vulnerable as you can't see them), rather keep them in view out of the corner of your eye and remain disinterested, they might grow disinterested too or distracted which would be your opportunity to quietly leave the area.   The aggressive criminal may realize the prey is street smart and starts thinking this person may have a hidden advantage which could prove fatal to them, especially if your hands start disappearing behind clothing or other objects and stay like that, like your reaching for a weapon. However do start placing some distance, saying nothing, that conveys you really don't want trouble, but your prepared to inflict substantial damage if attacked.   Don't try bluffing a aggressor, threatening them, reasoning with them or communicating with them if possible. Actions speak louder than words.   When you jockey your physical position to avoid a potential attack, do so in a manner that others are watching your back so the full 360º view is covered, in fact if around strangers, ask them to watch your back too. As soon as you "herd up" you have greatly improved your physical tactical advantage and safety.   One should be consciously making sure one doesn't wind up in situation where their alone and vulnerable to attack from a single attacker. It's rare to see groups of people attacking as it takes the entire group to be highly motivated, it's mostly one highly and desperate person trying to find a easy mark.       In one's home,  don't leave the computer or device out.   In a fashion that it can be quickly taken in a burglary or by a visitor with a problem unknown to you who can slip it into their pocket and then claim ignorance or threaten to sue you for defamation of character when you accuse them of stealing once they have left.   Don't have the device(s) viewable from the front door, or via a window, or entryway, like a lot of home offices are located right near the front door where delivery people arrive and thus can inform others of potential targets. Burglars often "case" a location for it's reward potential before attempting a break in as they don't want to get caught, some just go ahead and do it the first time they know your not home and grab whatever they can and run as the alarm is blaring.   The objective is to reduce their reward potential and their time limit, also the knowledge of who knows what about your possessions.   The iMac and the MacPro has a nice large holes in the rear where a  thick chain can be employed discretely to anchor the machine down to a wall stud or concrete anchor out of view. The burglar may give it a tug and notice it's chained down, not even bother, rather opting for another object they deem is of value and they can carry off faster instead.   If they don't see another object and get upset they can't get the computer, they may smash it, but at least you will still have it's data and can make a insurance claim. Leave out some bait objects like some dead  X-Boxes in a pile that looks perfect for the single burglar to carry them all away, haha.   The MacBook Pro and other small computers should be locked in a non-movable safe and/or hidden in some fashion where it takes longer to find it. The thin security cables used to lock MacBook Pro's are just about worthless and only used to keep honest people honest, or having observed machines from being moved around. A thief see's that thin cable and just goes and shoplifts themselves a pair of cutters they can hide in their pocket and use in a few seconds to cut the cable and make off with the machine.   Since computers can be replaced and are usually of less value than your data, you should also make multiple backups like bootable clones of your entire boot partition on a external drive and keep it in a safe or other locations like bank safe deposit boxes. Reason for this is simple, if they take your computer, they are going to take the TimeMachine drive hooked up to it as well, you will be glad to have a bootable clone and other backups in a safe someplace off site.       In one's vehicle,  don't leave the computer or device out.   In a fashion that it can be seen by those peering through the windows.   If your data is extermely sensitive and you must leave the computer in the vehicle, I'd advise a car alarm and a metal chest bolted from the inside to the floor, perhaps behind the drivers seat for easy access and storing of laptops. One can use a floor mat to cover the box for passengers to rest their feet on it.   The trunk is another good location for a car safe. The object is to make it harder for smash and grabs to occur. Delay their access time while the alarm is sounding a alert.     Colleges are famous locations where a lot of theft occur.   It's because people who have come from safe environments where they trusted everyone not to steal meet people who come from places that do. Combine that with the fact that a lot of young college students are on limited budgets, the large amount of people involved making finding the person responsible difficult, makes theft of pricey Apple objects a highly often occurring behavior on campuses.   Another potential for theft is having your iPod, iPhone or GPS mounted on the dashboard of your vehicle, sometimes those electronic remote unlock buttons get hit accidentally when you place them into your pocket, popping open your doors and even your truck as you walk away. Had a iPod stolen that way and I was right inside the house,10 feet away, when it occurred, that's how brazen thieves can be.   When evaluating your location security, consider what can be done and the time it takes to do so. For instance, windows large enough for someone to fit through, walls soft enough to tunnel through or doors easily jimmied with a crowbar; how to you defend your items inside after that has occurred? How much time does a burglar have before the police arrive to grab something and run away?   Think like a criminal who is trying to get inside,  undetectable, grab as much value, with the least amount of confrontation and getting away successfully, all as easily as possible. Place unexpected barriers to all those actions they can potentially take, without jeopardizing yourself in the process, as you can't always be around all the time to protect your valuables.     About recovery efforts after the fact with stolen Apple items.   You should file a report along with the serial number etc., with your local law enforcement. There might be a good chance it can be recovered along with other items if the thief or fence is caught, but don't place your hopes too high on recovery, you likely won't want it back anyway as it's likely to have been damaged.   Don't place great faith in the "find my computer" other attempts at recovery after the theft occurred. It can sometimes catch the local dumb thief, it's really used as a deterrent but won't stop a seasoned pro or one smart enough to remove themselves several times away from the stolen device, or wait until the "heat" is off.   Your best bet is to practice preventative measures in all aspects of your life and not rely too much upon measures after the fact, just if you get lucky it can be returned by a slip-up by the crooks.   https://support.apple.com/kb/HT2526     note: work in progress	Sun Jul 29 08:25:51 IST 2012

I contacted the retailer where I purchased it and he told me to do a reset by pushing the Home button and Sleep button at the same time.

I can you iMessage on my iPhone no problem between other iMessage friends. The problem is being able to do like they advertise and be able to pick up on the iMessage from my iPad.   I did seem to notice that the iPad likes to use email addresses instead of phone numbers is that true?? If so does that mean on my iPhone I need to start an iMessage using email instead of phone number? I also tried sending an iMessage to my friends apple I'd email that has iOS5 and it's says he does not have the ability to use iMessage with that email (in red with ! Next to email and phone number).   To me that seems to silly and not apple like. So I am hoping that I am missing a setting or something to get this fixed.   Any ideas?   Thanks, Caleb	Thu Oct 13 20:55:55 IST 2011	
https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5583649	iOS 7 - Apps Won't Open From Updates Tab Anymore?	I do not know if this is a widespread problem or not, because I have searched exhaustively online to find an answer, but to no avail.  So here is the issue that I am experiencing in iOS 7 on my iPad 4.   Previously before I updated to iOS 7.0.4, I believe it is.  Well, whenever I used to go to the "Updates" section on my iPad for all of the applications that I have installed, I could open the apps from the "Updates" section.  What I mean is that if I had an app listed that required an update, I could read the description for the newest update, and also click the Update button for said app.  I can still do these two things on iOS 7.  But previously I used to be able to click on the icon for an app in my "Updates" list and I could open up that app's App Store page.  This was important to me, because I always prefer to read the latest reviews and ratings for an application before I just blindly upgrade and update it.   But, as far as I can see, I am no longer able to access an application's App Store page from the "Updates" section on my iPad anymore.  Because try as I may, I just keep clicking on the app icons and they never launch the app's App Store page like they used to do, pre-iOS 7.  Is anyone else having this same problem occur on their iPad or iPhone?  I can, of course, still back out of the "Updates" tab and go into the App Store to read an application's reviews before I update it.  But in my opinion, that is just so stupidly inefficient, and a huge step backwards from the previous operating system.  Why would they change this feature for the worse by removing the ability to do this?  Anyways, thank you in advance for any help or advice that anyone can offer me, I appreciate it very much and I am very grateful to you, thank you.

Dear All,   I started to generate on my MacBook, with the Tools provided with XCode 5, to generate a dictionary for the Dictionary App which runs fine on my Max OSX machines. Now I wonder if there is a way to upload the dictionary to the hidden dictionary app of iOS to use the dictionary on iPad and iPhone via the "define"-option of highlighted words. All of curse under the assumption both applications use the same dictionary formate, what I guess since both outputs look very similar. The hidden app of iOS downloads dictionaries somehow from iCloud as the cloud symbol suggests. But does anyone know how to upload dictionaries to there e.g. from a MacBook to be able to download it subsequently with iPad or iPhone in the "manage"-Mode of the hidden dictionary app?   Thanks in advance for any suggestions, Juergen	Tue Nov 19 20:36:24 IST 2013

This problem also applies to my phone. Someone else asked this question and got a really inane answer from someone who said "they will come back".... when? They should never have disappeared in the first place. I've had friends open their app store and it shows their previously purchased but no longer installed apps no problem. What am I missing here? Is it down to a setting as to why they are no longer showing? Something to do with iTunes or iCloud?   This issue is really starting to irk me because some apps I had deleted from my iPad I wanted to re download again. These apps were PAID for. I searched for these apps in the app store and it didn't say "Install" anymore like they usually do when i had paid for it before, it was asking me to pay.... AGAIN.   Since when has it been a case of when you pay, and delete you the pay again?   My purchased tab is empty. It doesn't show a single app. It says "All of your available apps have been downloaded to this device" same goes for my iPhone. This ins't the case AT ALL.

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5720213	Movie Won't Download from iTunes on iPad	I recently purchased two movies from iTunes using a gift card I got for Christmas. I started the download and once the first movie got too about 3.2 GB of 6.2' it stopped and started over for no apparent reason. I tried multiple times to download both movies with no luck the first 24 hours. Was hoping to have it for my flight for my vacation. Over the course of the next three days I have tried downloading the first movie at least 15 times on various WiFi networks, It always begins the download and then either restarts it on it's own or now gives me an error message saying the movie cannot be downloaded at this time, please try again later. I finally got the second movie to download after 10 attempts, but still no luck with the first. I know for certain I had a continuous WiFi connection every time. I am EXTREMELY frustrated at this point. I still have remaining dollars to spend from my gift card, but figure why even bother? I really hope someone can give me an idea which works. So far I have deleted the beginning download on multiple occasions and also tried restarting after this 4 times and nothing seems to work.	Sun Dec 29 10:43:20 IST 2013

Two items I've purchased on iTunes using my iPad running iOS 7.0.2 keep returning an error message that they can't "be downloaded at this time".   As one is a song, I've downloaded it nicely on the iPhone, hence I can tell it's not a server related or specific file issue, just some annoying bug in iTunes   So far I've tried pretty much everything, with no luck: - close iTunes app and relaunch it - gard resetting the iPad (holding jome and power button) - reset all setting - swipe finger right to left over athe item (nothing happens)   Seems there's no way to remove an item in the download queue, even there's an "edit" button in the top left corner. It produces no effect. Any hint? I'd really would like to avoid restoring the iPad from scratch!   Thank you	Wed Oct 02 15:10:03 IST 2013

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6092338	iPad Air 3G Signal	Well, only a few weeks ago I got a brand new iPad Air and from the very beginning the 3G signal bars have shown an average of 2 dots with a vodafone uk sim However when you use the speedtest app it struggles to connect to the internet. At first I thought this May have been vodafone uk's fault but I then decided to change to an ee sim as the 3G signal is faster and stronger in my area. With this ee SIM card it is still having the same troubles, I have normally 3 dots but at times it doesn't connect to the internet or when it does it is really fast. This has been testing it when it's been in the same spit and not moved at all. The other thing is I have an old ipad 2 on ee and it's positioned where the Air is and it connects to the internet first time very time. I have a feeling my problem lies with the iPad. What are the thoughts of the people? Anyone having the same problem? Any advice?   Thank you.	Tue Apr 15 21:10:24 IST 2014

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6091402	What is a good non-slip case for an iPad Air?	I just traded in my two or so year old iPad Mini for an iPad Air, in part because I've never taken to extended typing on the surface of the iPad Mini.  At a recent house party I noted a friend of mine was using an iPad (not the Air) and a Logitech keyboard and I, without a wjole lot of resistance, talked myslf into this new machine which I've combined with a sturdy but extremely pleasant to use Belkin Ultimate keyboard.  What I've given up has been a very decent non-keyboard Stm case that I used with the Mini.  The Belkin case/keyboard combination is a bit slippery and notably heavier, of course than the Mini in its Stm case.  I'd like to be able to substitute a good, lighter, non-keyboard case for the Belkin for travel and other times when I don't expect to do much keyboard work.   The Mini's Stm case was covered in a fairly rough cloth with an easy non-grip, amost knubby texture.  So far, at the Mac Store (I haven't tried the Apple Store) and Seattle's University Bookstore I've found only non-keyboard cases that seem pretty smooth, lacking the nice non-slip texture of my old, now discarded Mini Stm case.  I'll appreciate any suggestions here for good non-slip non-keyboard cases for my new iPad Air.  I can't tell from Stm's online site, for example, whether the iPad Air cases have a good non-slip finish and I'm certainly open to other good brands as well.

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5597256	iPad Air, rendering glitches	PDF rendering in iBooks and Safari on my iPad Air will occasionally yield large black blocks of unrendered image. This seems to be related to the re-processing done by the OS when zooming; it is reproducible and can be triggered by zooming in on a single page of a PDF.   Further, more than occasionally, a page will be stuck at the lower-resolution buffer and won't be switched out for the higher resolution re-render until I force-quit the application.   My question is this: is this a common occurrence? Standard behavior of the Air under iOS 7 at the moment? Or does mine have some bad memory, yielding buffer corruption? If I brought it to the Apple Store, could they tell me one way or the other?   Thanks a bunch!	Mon Nov 25 00:58:32 IST 2013	
https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6084371	iPad PDFs in iBooks disappear on syncing with Mac	Hi all, I use Safari on my iPad to download PDFs for my University course, and sort them into collections within iBooks according to what subject they belong to. This all works fine until I sync with my iMac via USB or WiFi. Sometimes, not every time, when I sync the iPad, some of these PDFs disappear out of iBooks on my iPad. I have to re-sync the iPad, go to the "Books" tab in iTunes, sort the books by date so I can find the ones I want, and put a check next to them (I have too many PDFs to want to sync them all.) Then I sync again, and the books are back - for the time being. Sadly, though, PDFs that I download from the University's online service often have non-meaningful names like "DirectFileDownload", and when I have renamed these at the time with meaningful names, these names are all lost when re-syncing after the disappearing act. However, at least iBooks remembers which collection the PDFs were in. The worst aspect is when I sync my iPad and forget to check afterwards if the PDFs are still there, and head off to Uni without them ...   I have selected the option to synchronise my collections across devices using iCloud, so that the same PDFs are in the same collections when I am working from my desktop at home. Could this be causing the problem? Could it be something else? Am I doing anything wrong?	Sun Apr 13 03:26:25 IST 2014

My wife and I have our personal iCloud and iTunes Store accounts setup in a way that I thought Apple recommended:   - I have my own iCloud account for all email, sync, and backup features - my wife has her own iCloud account for all email, sync, and backup features - we share a third Apple ID for all iTunes and App Store purchases   However, we're starting to read more iBooks together, and we've found that iBooks syncs your bookmarks/notes/highlights between devices via the iTunes Store account, not the primary iCloud account (Apple's documentation also states this under Can I bookmark and save my page? http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5557).   Is there a way to get iBooks to sync this stuff via the device's primary iCloud account, not the iTunes Store account? Since everything else syncs via the iCloud account, could this just be an oversight in how iOS syncs things that Apple might fix soon?

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5577453	iPad Air and lost PDFs in iBooks update iOS 7.04	Mentioned in another thread, but as I felt it better dealt with in its own thread, here is the sequence of events.   After the purchase of a new iPad Air 64 Gb cellular and wifi capable, the recommended  APPLE procedure was followed in setting it up, but with the following diversions.   Using my MacBook Pro  running mavericks   1.  Fully updated, synced and backed up my old iPad 1.   2.  Hooked up my new iPad air, to the MacBook, and reset it to the factory default system, then restored from the ipad1 backup. This put all the stuff on my older iPad1 onto my iPad Air, but gave the new iPad the same id as the old one.   3.  Changed the name of the new iPad by adding "Air" to the  name planted on it by the restore from backup, mentioned in ( 2 ).   4.  Fully updated and synced and backed up the new iPad in iTunes under its new name.   ////////.       This gives me the new iPad fully updated and working, AND the older iPad1 still operable with wifi but no cellular, with all stuff working well.   ////////.       I suppose I may be considered a little cautious by most, but having dealt with computers and the like since the early 1970's, this caution has proven very               helpful. As subsequently proven.   ////////.        I used and still use the app " ForScore " for my digital usage of PDF music, instead of using the printed music books, which was a little awkward when using both hands to play my instrument,  ( a guitar) . I use the Bluetooth " Airturn" foot switch to turn the pages as required, very helpful!   ////////.         While I had most of my music in PDFs in " ForScore" there was quite a lot of my earlier collections still residing in iBooks which were to be transferred as required.   In the natural course of events, APPLE  put out the iOS updates 7.03 and 7.04, and also came up with the option of putting iBooks on the MacBook OSX.   Fully trusting APPLE to develop and adequately verify their stuff before putting it out  as updates, I installed everything that they threw at me, the same as everybody else, who now have a problem similar to me , but perhaps with fewer recovery options.   MY PDF's  HAD  DISAPPEARED FROM THE IBOOKS APP ON BOTH THE IPAD AIR AND THE MACBOOK!!!!!!!     But still resided on the old ipad1!   Thankfully those in " ForScore " and all the other separate apps such as " MusicNotes"  and "GigBook"  we're in no way effected, and survived this disruption.   ///////.         So while I have no problems operating with what I now have, that is , working PDFs on my old and my new iPads, I have as well access to those files backed up in iTunes, resulting from the procedure undertaken above.    ////////.         All I have to do is get at them!!!!!!!!!!!   I clearly am not the only iOS and OSX user with this problem, many others though find themselves in a much worse situation than I am,  and requiring a much more convoluted recovery, if APPLE doesn't soon rectify its vandal like departure from the accepted norm.   ///////////.       ForScore handles all sorts of PDFs , not only those related to music, the size of the PDF is not a  hindrance , and it's in app capabilities such as, annotation, modifying, building , importing and exporting, re-ordering etc, and it is where all my PDF files will be placed for future safer residence.   I hope this little episodic description may be helpful to some current and future  APPLE  disciples.   I still am one, but as cautious as ever.

Basically, my ipad mini will not switch on or charge, it will only display this image http://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/features/3467293/black-ipad-charging-slowly -main.jpg (except obviously the ios7 version of this image). Having spoken to a couple of Apple online support employees, it seems it is a battery issue as I have tried charging it with a couple of different cables and usb to wall socket adapters, all of which work fine with another ipad mini. Now the ipad is dead (other than the aforementioned image flashing up when the on/home buttons are pressed), will all the data likely have been wiped off? As I am nervous of Genius bar employees/family members who are coming with me to go on safari/notes/photos as there are some *very private* and quite frankly embarrassing things on there... I think you know the point I am hinting at!. Is it likely they will be able to access this in store- will they likely fix the ipad in store or send it away for repair? Obviously they will not access personal apps, e.g. Facebook, Kik, Snapchat etc, would they open photos or safari etc without my permission whilst I was with them or look at my bookmarks/history whilst I was there with them? To be honest I do not care if they access this whilst repairing the device out of the store but could not face them seeing these embarassing items on my device whilst I or my family were there! Sorry for the very long question, I would just like to know;   1) Will there likely be any data left, assuming this is a battery issue? 2) Will Apple be able to fix or replace the battery in store or would the ipad be sent away? 3) Will they browse my photos/notes pages or safari bookmarks/history whilst in store?   Thanks, apologies again for the long-winded post, just want to put my mind at rest/know what to expect.

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6096557	I got an iPad mini and it wouldn't charge or turn on, so i got it exchanged. I got the same exact problem with the new one after about a week. In both instances it was completely charged. I tried the reset on both and the apple logo won't appear on either	I got an 16GB iPod mini for my birthday last month. It was working great for about a week. I let my tablet charge overnight and in the morning it would not turn on. I let it charge all day that day it still would not turn on. I did research and tried doing the reset, but the apple logo will not appear. We were able to replace it with  a brand new one. The new one is having the same problem after about the same amount of time, again charged. I did even more research and found out that an app may have taken control of my iPad. can this really happen? if not, what can i do to fix it?	Thu Apr 17 06:05:36 IST 2014

I was watching an ep of naruto on crunchyroll and all of a sudden the app closed down, I opened it back up but the video wouldn't load, so I tried some other videos and none would load. After this i decided to see if Netflix or HBO Nordic would let me stream video, but, they wouldn't. So i tested Youtube and it worked fine. For some reason none of my streaming services work on ipad anymore, but they work great everywhere else. I'd like to know if anyone knows how to fix this?   I have tried closing all apps and rebooting it by holding the top button and the home button but it didn't help.   and also sorry for my bad english	Tue Apr 15 15:11:33 IST 2014

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6083156	iPad No Display - Goes to DFU if left ON - iTunes detects in Recovery	Hello World,   I have an iPad2 WiFi 16GB that has gone dead. I was perfectly working a few weeks back but now it’s almost dead.   The problem was first observed on a morning when I tried to press the home button and the screen wouldn’t come on. I thought the battery was down and tried to charge it. Having connected it to a charger, there were no charge indications displayed on its LCD. Usually I see the red battery charge icon when connected to a power source. In the evening when I came back from office, it was still stuck on the blank screen with zero display no backlight either. I swapped with another charger but still the same story. Then I tried to hard reset it, and viola, the screen powered up and booted back again. No issues for 2 days. Then the same problem on 3rd day and so I hard reset it again and when it booted back I noticed that the charge was about 70%. So I knew the problem was not due to low charge. This started going on for a month. As time passed I couldn’t hard reset it straight away and it was getting tougher to get the iPad working. I would have to keep pressing the home button and power button for more than 20 seconds for the screen to come back up. My chances of waking the iPad was better if I connected it to a charger and if the battery was charged above 90%. It became harder and harder to get the iPad working. I observed that if the iPad is always connected to the charger this problem never happens. You can leave it for a week and no issues at all. It is when there is no charger connected to it and if the iPad blanks the screen due to inactivity and within 10 minutes of standby the problem starts to appear.   Since this was happening quite often I thought it could be a problem with the recently updated 7.0.4. So I thought I would upgrade it to 7.0.6 and see how it goes. With the blank screen iPad I connected to its USB cable and to my surprise iTunes detects it in DFU mode. This is the DFU with blank screen not the recovery screen that shows up with "Connect to iTunes picture" on the screen. But, if I try to update the iOS it would get stuck at the progress bar forever. No activity is observed at this point. The only way to reinstall the OS is try to hard reset the iPad by pressing the home + power buttons for more than 20 (if you are lucky) seconds and see if it comes out from DFU with a boot logo of Apple. During power up keep pressing the home button so that it enters into the recovery mode ("Connect to iTunes picture"). Then iTunes can reinstall it. But when it reboots same problem. So I know it’s not the iOS issue. Something else would have gone wrong. As time passed by the iPad wouldn’t wake up at all. It wants to be in DFU all the time. The 20 second hard reset work around too failed and it was impossible to get the iPad working. I thought it could be the battery playing up. So I purchased the iPad2 battery off ebay for $13 and replaced it. The multi-meter showed it had about 3.4v before replacing (the one in it showed about 2.8v). But, still the same issue. There is no way the iPad displays anything except if I connect to iTunes and try to reinstall the iOS. In that case it would get stuck in the progress bar at 0% with the Apple logo on top.   I need some expert opinion here. Taking it to apple for repair is not an option and the iPad is out of warranty. I would like to repair this myself and would like to know the cause of such an issue. I am an advanced user so any wise observation, expert opinions are welcome. Appreciate your time in advance.   Thanks Sinu Chacko	Sat Apr 12 18:44:04 IST 2014

Since Day One (OK, maybe Day 201), it has crashed and quit apps and lost content in files. I basically stopped using it for anything important work-wise (it's a work computer). Finally, I gave up and took it into an Apple store for a clean wipe and restart. So, here's my problem: It's basically like a new iPad and is walking me thru the first activation steps. But about the third step, it asks me to log in with my apple ID, since that's what was synched to this device. I have multiple Apple IDs, and can't remember the password for this particular one. Simple enough, I thought, just get a password reset email. It took awhile for the email to arrive, but when it did, it was for some random AppleID that is a mac.com one, and nothing I use is linked to that ID. This is NOT the Apple ID I requested the password for.   I can't reactivate the iPad because I can't log in with my Apple ID without password, and I can't get a password reset from this specific AppleID from Apple.   Suggestions?

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/6075321	Storage Space Problems with iPad Mini	I was trying to load an update to Clash of Clans and received repeated error messages that I lacked adequate storage space and that I needed to make changes.  I deleted some things and show that I have 12.5 GB of storage avaiable which should be more than enough.  Additionally, I can't load the IOS 7.1 update because it requires 2.5 GB of storage...again, I have 12.5 GB per the "About".   Lastly, as I tried to log in I received messages "incorrect entry", it wasn't incorrect, but I played along and I changed the password.    Help, I am trying to fix this and am totally failing.   Thanks in advance!

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5334429	Ipad Disabled	I upgraded my Ipad to IOS7 and it asked me for the 4 digit password which I had just set up because it asks you to input that after the download. It is saying it is wrong and I cannot unlock my IPAD now. I know I am putting in the only 4 digit password I use. I have been looking online how to reset it and it looks like I will lose everything. The last time I backed up my Ipad on my PC was a year ago. This is not good. Is there a glitch with the new IOS7? Any ideas what else I can try?	Fri Sep 20 11:52:13 IST 2013

I want to buy the new retina iPad mini while I am in Hong Kong for my semester abroad but I want to have it protected with an Apple Care Protection Plan for when I'm back in Europe. I was told that the protection plan is region specific for iPads and that my iPad won't be covered in Europe if I buy Apple Care in HK.

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5136120	iPad mini region issues?	Yo,   I have been searching for this and I only found question about this of years ago, so I decided to make a discussion about it. I am going on vacation to USA and I'm planning to buy an iPad mini there. I got a few wuestions: 1. I live in Europe. Is it possible to setup the device in my language (dutch)? 2. Can I download apps directly to my iPad? 3. If so, can I get access to the Dutch apple store? (I think so cause I can access American app stores too) 4. Can I download any european/dutch apps? 5. Aside from not being able to register my iPad, will tuere be any other issues? Thanks :)	Sat Jun 29 03:14:51 IST 2013

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/5007381	Change iOS Map "Region"	I live in China and bought an iPad Mini here. I set it up in English, and it seems to function exactly as a "UK iPad" except for the inbuilt navigation maps. These are in Chinese, and are very thin on detail in places like the UK. Is there a way I can get the UK map versions? Under settings, all I can do is swap miles and km.   I know there are alternatives, such as Google Maps, but I have a number of apps that use the inbuilt "Apple" map.   Thanks,   Matt	Wed May 01 09:42:03 IST 2013

https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3993187	Regional Format	Hi all, it's not a massive issue but one I'd like to fix if possible. I live in United Arab Emirates and use Awesome Note as calendar application on my iPad. ANote does not offer support to change first day of week to Sunday, it operates off the local set gregorian values in Region Format.   The problem is that if I set region to UAE the clock and calendar become arabic. No matter what language settings I use elsewhere I can not get this to change. If I set to UK then the calendar starts on a monday.   The only solution I've been able. To find so far is to set region to hong kong. This does first day as Sunday and maintains everything else in English. Not sure if this will have unforeseen effects elsewhere though.   If anyone can suggest anything I'd be grateful.	Thu May 31 22:29:11 IST 2012
