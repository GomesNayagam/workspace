108,34,30/1/2014,"the case feels quite a lot more durable than the less expensive options, has great access to all ports, and runs very quietly."
109,34,30/1/2014,a laptop that can actually work both as a laptop or as a desktop replacement solution so well is rare.
110,34,30/1/2014,"the keyboard has also been extremely easy to get used to, compared to many other laptop keyboards out there."
111,35,29/1/2014,i’ve owned several desktops over the years and this was my very first laptop purchase.
112,35,29/1/2014,"i was looking for a simple basic machine that i could take with me to check e-mail, find restaurants/attractions on vacation or watch a movie or play a basic game on the airplane (it’s not a “gaming” machine)."
113,35,29/1/2014,"however, this little laptop has excelled in all of these plus some more."
114,35,29/1/2014,i’ve installed ms office and some photo editing software and it performs just fine using these.
115,35,29/1/2014,the 500gb is plenty big enough for anything i’m doing.
116,35,29/1/2014,"it’s really thin and lightweight, around 5 pounds."

118,35,29/1/2014,i get about 4 hours of operation out of it watching a couple of movies or general working.
119,35,29/1/2014,it also has 4 usb ports (two 2.0 and two 3.0) and an hdmi port which i thought was kinda cool.
120,35,29/1/2014,the only con i have is that i wish it had come with windows 7 since it’s not a touch screen.
121,35,29/1/2014,"overall i think it’s one of the best, if not the best, values for a basic laptop which has several additional nice features."
122,36,27/1/2014,bought this for my wife to replace an emachine celeron box.
123,36,27/1/2014,happy with the overall purchase and experience.
124,36,27/1/2014,"in the spirit of honesty, i am a brandx services employee and with the discounted price and my employee discount, it was a very good purchase."
125,36,27/1/2014,wife had enough issues moving from xp to win 7 a few years back so i knew i did not want to try to take her to win 8.
126,36,27/1/2014,"running it on a brandx 22"" monitor thru the adapter."
127,37,27/1/2014,i simply love this computer.
128,37,27/1/2014,it was my first one with a touch screen and it was very simple to set-up and begin using.
129,37,27/1/2014,it would have saved me time overall.
130,37,27/1/2014,i would recommend this system to anyone for a really good all around daily use computer.
131,37,27/1/2014,"pros:easy to use, fast and efficient, inexpensive, versitile cons:too many preloaded apps, no app tutorial on desktop."
132,38,25/1/2014,"my previous one lastest 3 years, so decided to take the plunge again and it was well worth it."
133,38,25/1/2014,"the laptop is much faster than my previous one, there is barely any sound or heat."
134,38,25/1/2014,"the graphics are clear, and it doesnt seem to bogged down with brandx software like my last one did."
135,38,25/1/2014,"the number pad isnt really useful to me, and would much rather have a fuller keyboard but it doesnt bother me and i am sure some will find it useful."
136,38,25/1/2014,"windows 8 is a bit scary at first, but its actually a great operating system and is well worth having once you get used to it - makes the whole thing more fluid and personal once you pin and move all your apps."
137,39,22/1/2014,"i use the modelx for all my computing needs, the non-touch is definitely worth the money, and that extra hundred for touch is preference."
138,39,22/1/2014,it has common durability.
139,39,22/1/2014,"get windows 8 pro for the extra security (bitlocker), extra speed, and accessibility."
140,39,22/1/2014,"it feels like a small desktop, and ironically has more storage than my windows 7 gateway."
141,41,17/1/2014,"this may make a great computer for a high school student, or a college student, but not for someone who does not want a loud clicking sound from the touch pad disrupting meetings."
142,41,17/1/2014,"other than that, it is not a bad buy."
143,41,17/1/2014,"it is my third brandx purchase, and probably my last."
144,42,14/1/2014,it not widi ready so if you are planning to use it with you hdtv or smart tv don not bother.
145,42,14/1/2014,it dose not have intel widi.
146,43,22/12/2013,"this pc is responsive, fast, and easy-to-use."
147,43,22/12/2013,"i was skeptical of the windows 8 operating system, but it is very nice."
148,44,22/12/2014,my fault that i didn not understand no dvd/dvr writer but other than that very happy with what i got for what i paid
149,45,17/11/2013,"i thought i reviewed this product thoroughly before purchasing, but this one got past me."
150,45,17/11/2013,"i came back online, today, to see if the part was missing, and that is when i realized the darn thing is optional."
151,45,17/11/2013,"then, when i clicked to choose one, i was taken to a goofy page that explained how to choose one, only."
152,45,17/11/2013,"i searched all dvd drives (don not want a cd type), but got tired of clicking to see that this model was not listed."
153,45,17/11/2013,you know that annoying floating-popup asking if you want to chat?
154,45,17/11/2013,"i clicked it just to read that chat is not available, try later."
155,46,17/11/2013,the power supply plugs into the left rear side of the laptop instead of the back.
156,46,17/11/2013,there are 4 usb ports with 1 being exactly where the mouse pad and mouse are located.
157,46,17/11/2013,"i got it at a good price, but am not happy."
158,46,17/11/2013,i do love the performance and wanted windows 7 os instead of windows 8.
159,47,16/11/2013,"this was a wise purchase, a good value, easy to get used to,and performs well."
160,47,16/11/2013,it also arrived several days ahead of schedule.
161,48,22/11/2013,"i recently purchased a new laptop, the modelx."
162,48,22/11/2013,it seemed intuitive to me that i should order windows 8.
163,48,22/11/2013,isn not it obvious that it would be better than the previous version?
164,48,22/11/2013,i hate that operating system.
165,48,22/11/2013,i wanted a computer not a large app device.
166,48,22/11/2013,and it turns out the new computer is much heavier.
167,48,22/11/2013,so after much hemming and hawing decided to return it.
168,48,22/11/2013,"yes i know i should have checked that, but there was the whole holiday travel thing in there as well."
169,48,22/11/2013,"so alas, i have a heavy laptop with an obnoxious operating system that we don not want."
170,49,17/11/2013,it has all the basic feature you need.
171,51,20/2/2014,if i could i would return this laptop today for something that performs at a reasonable speed as a 6 time brandx computer owner this is the worst by far...
172,52,15/2/2014,"the windows 8 operating system is designed for social media, but not for business applications."
173,52,15/2/2014,"if you desire a toy, this computer will meet your needs."
174,52,15/2/2014,"it does not function with serious business software, and is almost impossible to upgrade to windows 7 professional."
175,53,14/2/2014,do not buy brandx laptop as part quality is not good and get failed soon and upon it extended warranty package cost too much..
176,54,12/2/2014,but then putting up with windows 8 has been a night mare.
177,54,12/2/2014,i want to throught this laptop at the wall.
178,55,10/2/2014,"having problem staying online, constantly timing out."
179,55,10/2/2014,i have three other devices and none of them have this problem.
180,56,6/2/2014,t is pretty slow but it works.
181,56,6/2/2014,cannot install windows video editor because it doesn not meet minimum machine requirements.
182,56,6/2/2014,first time with windows 8 and hate it.
183,57,1/2/2014,websites take a while to load and seems delayed.
184,57,1/2/2014,may be returning this laptop.
185,59,28/1/2014,product is good for the money.
186,59,28/1/2014,"however not a fan of ""chicklet"" keyboard which feels light and very cheaply made."
187,59,28/1/2014,"they really should be in the back, otherwise you end up with wires coming out of sides of laptop and hindering viable desk space on sides of the laptop"
188,60,23/1/2014,"very inconvenient to type on, but good to watch some online shows where space is limited."
189,60,23/1/2014,"overall not too bad, but the mousepad is a nightmare."
190,61,22/1/2014,received my new laptop today and it is brilliant!!
191,61,22/1/2014,windows 8 has taken a bit of getting use to but easy to pick up.
192,61,22/1/2014,excellent laptop for a great price only problem is that the buttons on the mouse pad are loud when you press them but that is not such a big problem.
193,61,22/1/2014,i would recommend this product!
194,62,22/1/2014,great computer!
195,63,22/1/2014,i needed a basic laptop to handle my business needs and maybe a little personal stuff as well from time to time.
196,63,22/1/2014,i am having a little bit of an issue with the touch pad.
197,63,22/1/2014,the other problem with it is the black trim around the keypad is trash.
198,63,22/1/2014,though not brandx is problem windows 8 has frozen up on me several times and most of the problem there is because of ie 10.
199,63,22/1/2014,i hate it and use chrome now.
200,63,22/1/2014,"overall the laptop so far is doing the basic job i need it for and that is to handle sales, inventory, and email."
201,63,22/1/2014,i would not recommend this for a power user or someone who wants to do heavy internet usage.
202,63,22/1/2014,also the power cable plugs in on the left side.
203,64,12/1/2014,this is very misleading and there is no-where visible to actually add this feature as a 'paid extra'.
204,64,12/1/2014,i took 'optional' as meaning you either have it switched on or off.
205,64,12/1/2014,"have tried ringing brandx today, on phone for 38 minutes, transferred at least 9 times to different assistants and after repeating myself each time, gave up."
206,64,12/1/2014,feel a bit disappointed.
207,65,9/1/2014,i had been running a 5/6 year old modelx20 into the ground - it was so broken that i had the lid gorilla-glued to box lid hinges to keep it open - so my requirements for a new laptop weren not super high just to give you a frame of reference.
208,65,9/1/2014,i got the i3-3227u version and this little bugger seems pretty nice for the price for me.
209,65,9/1/2014,seems pretty fast for just about everything i need - a little web development as well as common usage.
210,65,9/1/2014,"i am a casual gamer, but i am usually playing stuff about 3-5 years behind its release, and this thing is pretty much smoking for that."
211,65,9/1/2014,fallout 3 is running nicely on high settings.
212,65,9/1/2014,the intel hd 4000 card did not disappoint (for me as a behind-the-times gamer).
213,65,9/1/2014,"and i have had it on my lap while playing and not gotten any lapburn or even felt much of a temperature rise
gripes are that the keyboard will need some getting used to - the arrow keys are pretty small and home, delete, etc are also."
214,66,16/10/2013,i thought i wasn not going to loveit much but i absolutely love it.
215,66,16/10/2013,"it is efficient and works well, everything seems organized and my internet or my wifi are both working great with speed."
216,66,16/10/2013,still learning new things about it but i love it.
217,66,16/10/2013,it is a lot more manageable than i thought it would be.
218,67,1/1/2014,i have brought this laptop on 12/04/2013 from the brandx exclusive store.
219,67,1/1/2014,its an awesome laptop but its cpu is not so powerful.
220,68,31/1/2014,i love using this computer for everything.
221,69,13/4/2013,"i have bought this laptop for working with office programs, adobe indesign, photoshop and other programs."
222,69,13/4/2013,also for internet and other light tasks.
223,70,17/7/2013,"i have always been a brandx customer and thought that was a good thing, but i find it difficult to understand how 2 of the same laptops could be so different."
224,70,17/7/2013,one has worked well since i got it and the other purchased at the same time has been nothing but problems.
225,70,17/7/2013,it has run very hot since i bought it and now it is at the point that it just continues to power off with limited use.
226,70,17/7/2013,the other one continues to work ok.
227,71,29/12/2013,i have the cheap model of modelx 3521.
228,71,29/12/2013,"after i installed the newest drivers very satisfied with it, it is a good machine for the price."
229,71,29/12/2013,"if you have not much money and aren not a gamer, i can recommend this notebook for you."
230,72,31/12/2013,i been a brandx lap top user for the past 7 years and i love it and all the support i get from brandx!!
231,73,2/1/2014,had a small problem with the shutdown button under the charms.
232,73,2/1/2014,luckily i only had the computer for a week and no major things saved to the computer after that everything works.
233,74,9/1/2014,surprisingly quick startup for a relatively inexpensive laptop.
234,74,9/1/2014,decent graphics.
235,74,9/1/2014,it is very quick in opening programs and such.
236,74,9/1/2014,"it has two usb 3.0 ports, which is a great thing for a laptop this inexpensive."
237,74,9/1/2014,the other is the fact that it doesn not come with recovery media.
238,74,9/1/2014,"other than those two things, this is a great machine and well worth the money."
239,74,9/1/2014,"it is not for high end games and graphics intensive things, but it is great for what it is designed for."
240,76,27/2/2013,i bought this computer for my nephew for school.
241,77,3/4/2013,very nice platform for windows 8.
242,77,3/4/2013,overall it is a nice computer for a budget price.
243,78,4/4/2013,purchased this on line direct from brandx.
244,78,4/4/2013,it shipped very quickly and arrived in good shape.
245,78,4/4/2013,i was easy to immediately begin using it.
246,79,5/4/2013,this laptop was no exception.
247,79,5/4/2013,"it is a good, steady machine."
248,80,8/4/2013,"the side connection are not the best way, prefer rear connections."
249,81,11/4/2013,this is my second brandx laptop and so far i am very happy with this one.
250,81,11/4/2013,"overall, i think it is a great laptop and it suits my needs perfectly."
251,82,15/4/2013,i would not trust another brandx but brandx.
252,82,15/4/2013,the product is good for everyday use.
253,83,5/5/2013,the speed is okay for everyday.
254,83,5/5/2013,the touch pad is working alright although it has that oily look very fast once you start using it.
255,84,15/7/2013,i have used computers since the timex zx80 and can say it is a great laptop.
256,84,15/7/2013,the only drawback is the textured surface which shows hand prints wherever it is touched.
257,84,15/7/2013,"the third edition cpu is fast enough for a laptop, will we ever be satisfied with the speed, no matter how fast."
258,85,25/6/2013,i am no stranger to brandx as this is our 3rd laptop direct from them.
259,85,25/6/2013,"our last brandx studio is still going strong, but i needed something with a little more punch for testing out component designs at home."
260,85,25/6/2013,"windows 8 is a peculiar one at first, but i sat down and went through the instructions 'getting started with windows 8 on your new brandx' that are provided."
261,85,25/6/2013,it is good that brandx had the forethought to include this and now i think windows 8 is superb!
262,85,25/6/2013,"the keyboard is a pleasure to use and the keys soft but still definite in operation, with the annoying gaps between closed off, saving the inevitable collection of biscuit crumbs that cause malfunction."
263,85,25/6/2013,"operating wise, it is fast to wake up, though i have yet to find a quick way to sleep - i am sure it will be there somewhere and i just need to find it."
264,85,25/6/2013,it is nice and fast to open programs and not found anything it couldn not cope with doing.
265,85,25/6/2013,the only thing i really don not like is that the plastic trim around the case just feels a little bit too cheap & nasty.
266,85,25/6/2013,"time over again, i would pay a bit more and get the metal trimmed option, but the same spec 15r wasn not available until the end of jan 2014."
267,86,26/5/2013,i use it as a back-up and sync it to my alienware desktop and take it on the road with me.
268,87,24/4/2013,it is a great machine.
269,88,11/4/2013,easy start up / set up.
270,88,11/4/2013,just needed a laptop for some low maintenance stuff on the go.
271,88,11/4/2013,purchased esp.
272,89,25/9/2013,"thankfully, brandx understands that windows 8 is not right for everybody."
273,89,25/9/2013,i tell everyone to shop brandx first.
274,90,19/11/2013,this is one great laptop and a great deal.
275,90,19/11/2013,"i see allot of reviews saying haw bad windows 8 but it just takes a little getting use to, once you know how to use the feature it has it works great."
276,91,19/11/2013,i ordered this computer and i just love it.
277,91,19/11/2013,was very skeptical of purchasing a computer with widows 8 because i had heard terrible things about it.
278,91,19/11/2013,computer is very user friendly and i have become very comfortable with using it.
279,91,19/11/2013,i would highly recommend this computer to others.
280,92,19/11/2013,have had no problems....love the machine!
281,94,19/11/2013,"i have had my new laptop a couple of months and i am very happy with my purchase.takes a little getting used to the new windows 8,not bad just different.i woul highly recommend brandx laptops and desktops as well.nothing but top of the line products."
282,95,20/11/2013,"i hoped it would stop after few minutes, but it didn not."
283,95,20/11/2013,"now every time i turn this laptop on, this sound bothers me, especially when i use the laptop in a quiet place."
284,95,20/11/2013,can someone help me to fix this problem so i don not have to return it?
285,96,20/11/2013,i got the modelx back in march 2013 a few months after it came out and have had it now for about eight months.
286,96,20/11/2013,it is a really nice computer.
287,96,20/11/2013,it is the most thin and lightweight computer i have ever had.
288,96,20/11/2013,windows 8 took a while to figure out but eventually you get used to it.
289,96,20/11/2013,"i also had an issue with it always showing fingerprints on the outside and on the mouse pad every time someone touched the laptop when it was new, but i don not really notice anymore the longer i have had it."
290,96,20/11/2013,it is packed full of features.
291,96,20/11/2013,i got it for a reasonable price with a discount.
292,96,20/11/2013,"after having the modelx, it is the exact same thing as more expensive and popular laptop brandxs except way cheaper and very affordable."
293,96,20/11/2013,i definitely don not regret purchasing this laptop and would buy it again any day.
294,97,20/11/2013,"given this laptop for my birthday and exceedingly pleased, windows 8 is fantastic as i gives you the option to go to normal view and the new layout."
295,97,20/11/2013,"the laptop itself is excellent, having used my old brandx desktop for the last 10 years, couldn not have hoped for a better laptop
nice for me to use as a student as i can do everything that i want to do and for my mum who uses it as well, so good to use for all people as you can do a variety of things."
296,97,20/11/2013,"only thing i would say is that the charge does not last for 7 hours on the go, but other than that fantastic, nice to be able to do tings quickly rather than wait an age to get anything done."
297,98,20/11/2013,many weeks of watching deals pass me by of touchscreen laptops.
298,98,20/11/2013,i didn not want to spend lot (didn not need financing).
299,98,20/11/2013,i chose the modelx.
300,98,20/11/2013,"i ordered on monday 3/11 and arrived 3/14, now that is fast delivery."
301,98,20/11/2013,"i am attaching some pictures of what is not so great and maybe not a big deal, but i have only used it for 3 days and fingerprints on the touch pad and the outside cover show!"
302,98,20/11/2013,"other than the fingerprints (yes i always wash my hands before i use the laptop), the laptop speed is great."
303,98,20/11/2013,is the outside cover replaceable (to something that doesn not show a lot of fingerprints)?
304,99,21/11/2013,it is easy to download from the store.
305,100,21/11/2013,"all are still working
great."
306,100,21/11/2013,"i called brandx up, and less than 2 minutes, brandx had to update drivers and i was up and running again."
307,100,21/11/2013,"at that time, i had so many question with this new system, amy at brandx was more than happy to help me resolve all
of my questions."
308,100,21/11/2013,"brandx stands behind their products, and they have always helped me resolve any issue."
309,100,21/11/2013,i am so glad i have this new modelx to work with!
310,101,23/1/2014,"when i was shopping for a laptop i was going to get the cheapes one i could find, but then said to myself why get one that would only last for a little bit then i would have to go and buy anotherone anyway."
311,101,23/1/2014,"i have had other brandx stuff before, so i know that the price i paid is well worth it."
312,101,23/1/2014,soon i am going to get me another laptop hear soon and its going to be a brandx to.
313,101,23/1/2014,i have told a few of my friends about it and thay to are going to get a brandx also.
314,102,19/11/2013,"i am very pleased with this product, it works great with surfing the web, light gaming and watching videos."
315,103,19/11/2013,"it is very good,i use it every day and it is very usefull to me."
316,104,19/11/2013,"i am a highschool student, and i was looking to purchase a laptop that was quicker to make school work easier."
317,104,19/11/2013,"this laptop is great not only for school work, but every other type of daily use."
318,104,19/11/2013,"one great feature is the start up time, which takes under a minute."
319,104,19/11/2013,i get over 4 hours on light usage.
320,104,19/11/2013,"the track pad on mine is very responsive, and the keyboard is well built and easy to type on."
321,104,19/11/2013,"another complaint was windows 8. personally, i think it is a huge improvement from windows 7. it is much easier to personalize and to use."
322,104,19/11/2013,overall this laptop is a great bargain.
323,104,19/11/2013,"it is well built (the fact that it is plastic isn not an issue - it is very sturdy and the texture is nice for repelling fingerprints), and works perfectly."
324,106,19/11/2013,i have the i3 3rd gen. with 6gb of ram.
325,106,19/11/2013,"i read other reviews, i have no clue what others are talking about, my computer boots up exceptionally quick."
326,106,19/11/2013,they are standing strong.
327,107,19/11/2013,i did a lot of research before buying the modelx from brandx.
328,107,19/11/2013,"as well, buying from a reputable source sealed the deal."
329,108,19/11/2013,it is a great machine.
330,109,19/11/2013,this is a great item and has wonderful features.
331,109,19/11/2013,i would recommend this product to anyone
332,110,11/12/2013,"affordable computer, excellent performance..great for college kids."
333,111,11/10/2013,"i bought this laptop as a gift for someone and they loved it, it works really good."
334,112,12/12/2013,"hey it is not perfect, but you cannot beat the overall performance for the price."
335,113,19/11/2013,great laptop overall.
336,115,19/11/2013,this is one great laptop and a great deal.
337,115,19/11/2013,"i see allot of reviews saying haw bad windows 8 but it just takes a little getting use to, once you know how to use the feature it has it works great."
338,116,11/12/2013,i recommend any brandx product to anybody !!!!!!!!
339,116,11/12/2013,we own several brandx laptops and never had any grief on buying any of them.
340,117,11/10/2013,enjoying my new laptop.
341,118,12/12/2013,have had no problems....love the machine!
342,119,19/11/2013,this pc has great features and i ues it for everything
343,120,19/11/2013,"first off, i want to say i have the ipad mini, ipad 2, the nook hd, and the kindle fire hd."
344,120,19/11/2013,all very impressive tablets.
345,120,19/11/2013,"after weeks of research, i had my eye on the sony tap 11, microsoft surface 2, microsoft surface pro 2, acer w4, and the lenovo miix2."
346,120,19/11/2013,i have experimented with other tablets including the surfaces and found a strong interest in their performance but i couldn not agree with the prices and the strip down version of windows 8.
347,120,19/11/2013,then i found this little gem.
348,120,19/11/2013,"a tablet with powerful hardware, a full windows 8.1 os, and a price nearly impossible to beat."
349,120,19/11/2013,the reviews seemed to rate this tablet 4.5/5 i was convinced.
350,120,19/11/2013,"after receiving the product, i fell in love with the performance as well as the speed, capabilities, and execution of the tablet."
351,120,19/11/2013,i seriously recommend this tablet.
352,121,19/11/2013,i am a technical professional  haveteran' (which just means old) of the semiconductor industry.
353,121,19/11/2013,"i have long been searching for a single, very mobile device that allows to travel light, yet effectively be capable when needed."
354,121,19/11/2013,(my company is a ms based enterprise).
355,121,19/11/2013,"will not be redundant here with detail, performance - excellent, surprisingly so."
356,121,19/11/2013,"i run full office365, some sharepoint apps and an old version of paperport."
357,121,19/11/2013,the dual band wifi has so far exceeded any other mobile device i have owned.
358,121,19/11/2013,one exception and this one of only 2 minor misses.
359,121,19/11/2013,"miracast for display is problematic(but works..with effort) knew this going in, but a mini-hdmi would make this an amazing tool for a traveling professional."
360,121,19/11/2013,if you are looking for a similar stylus experience to the 'note' then this isn not for you if it is critical.
361,121,19/11/2013,very 'marginal' for handwritten notes in 'onenote'.
362,121,19/11/2013,i use it for the handwriting input panel in win8.1 and works fine for this.
363,121,19/11/2013,personal use : excellent.
364,121,19/11/2013,note: i would recommend only 64gb model!
365,121,19/11/2013,"i made a mistake on my first one and ended up with 32gb (wife has this now) :) in my opinion, 32gb should not be sold."
366,121,19/11/2013,"you max out the memory in a heart beat, especially if you are using business apps."
367,121,19/11/2013,5gb 1080p mkv files with pass through dts audio play flawless in vlc.i give value 5 for 5 despite the 2 minor misses as i consider those my 'quest for the ultimate portable' and it is hard to knock considering the price-point and value.
368,121,19/11/2013,if this device had a mini-hdmi so i could use to present ppt and a smoother stylus for hand-writing notes on par with wacomm...this would be the device i have always searched for.
369,121,19/11/2013,"but hey, for the money amazing value/performance and quality."
370,121,19/11/2013,nice job brandx.
371,121,19/11/2013,"pros:screen, performance, mobility, battery, quality of build cons:stylus - 'jittery' but sensitive, no mini-hdmi."
