The two main programs are 'declist.py' and 'nltkbayes.py'. 

The scripts used to generate the test results in ./results.xlsx are in ./testing_scripts. I changed the directories around so you might have to move the data you want and the python programs into the same directory to use the scripts. Or you can just edit the file_paths where they are. 

The two perl scripts I used are in the main directory. 

The use in calling the two python programs is below. You use True/False command line arguments to call implement certain features. 

naivebayes.py neg_words, numeric, sent_len, bigrams, POS, spellcheck, num_features,file

declist.py file, num_features, num_rules

I couldn't move all the reviews to the CS machines because my quota is almost full. I can email them to you if you'd like to test the scripts.
