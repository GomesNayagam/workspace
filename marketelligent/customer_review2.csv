modelx,ecommerce Website,2/6/2014,4/5,"This is perfect laptop for everyday use. I got this for my mom, she knows enough to get the job done. Windows 8 has a little learning curve but it's nice. Right out of the box upgraded to Windows 8.1, much better. Touch pad is nice but uses a wireless mouse instead",To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,,,
modelx,ecommerce Website,2/7/2014,4/5,"Got this for our family. It is a very good entry level non-touch laptop for people who only use it for email, homework, and web browsing. It's design is clean and easy for people who prefer traditional tower PCs. Picture is sharp. Still getting used to Windows 8 UI. Don't think Tiles will go far. Pros:ease of use Cons:no cd/dvd-r, memory stuck at 4gb max.",To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,,,
