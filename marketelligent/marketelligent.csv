Inspiron 15,ecommerce Website,20/5/2013,4/5,"I have had this laptop a good few weeks now, tested it fully and know the positives and negatives. I have been purchasing systems only from Dell for 6 years, hopefully my review will help you out.Nice sleek, thin and comfortable designed laptop- the casing is very nice ridged texture that looks and feels brilliant. It does accumulate finger prints but nowhere near the level other systems do. It's also light weight. Screen is nice and wide, perfect for work, gaming and browsing the web. It has a glossy glare which is really nice, easy to clean and good quality. Bright and details are great. The Keyboard is perfect, easy to clean, stylish, nice quality feel and durable. Remember, black absorbs heat and makes it fade. Unfortunately I left mine in the sun and the keys have faded (that is my fault not the product) I'm still looking to find a replacement, would be great if I could be directed. Trackpad feels great, very responsive and easy to use. Left and right clickers (I made that word up) are very nice and feel like they're built with quality. However, sometimes the mouse freezes for anywhere up to 40 seconds when opening numerous programs or running scans. This does get a little bit frustrating especially knowing it's an i3 processor. The palm rest has a sharp-ish edge on it, but I'm sure that will wear down with use. I would say it lacks a bit of performance as it should load easy tasks in seconds, it does not always respond when I ask it to and some applications fail to load as quick as they should. Most of the time it works perfectly, it laggs very rarely. Intel HD Graphics is an integrated graphics card that is basic but still very good. I play a standard browser based MMO that runs at 40-45 out of 50 Frames Per Second, for me that is very good. It also handles some games well such as Skyrim, Dirt and Farcry at medium graphics.Audio is great, very loud and clear.Webcam is very nice, perfect for streaming, very high detailed with no 'jittering. Ports are good, the HDMI works perfectly and looks great with my TV. AC adapter is Standard yet very durable and lightweight. Windows8 isEasy to use, quickly able to adapt from taking a first time leap from XP all the way to the newest OS. At first I was a bit pessimistic, but I'm very happy with it's design, features and ease of use. Service and delivery was great from Dell as usual. A very satisfied customer and I won't fail to recommend this product. Cons:Disk tray is flimsy and not very well built when open, it still performs well. The casing on the front of the screen (trim where the webcam is) feels 'plasticy, weak and cheap, the back is ridged and a nice design though. Overall rating from me, 8/10. Some mildly rough patches but still a great system, the price is very decent for what you're getting.",To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,"laptop,screen,keyboard,trackpad,mouse,i3 processor,graphics card,Intel HD Graphics,Audio,Webcam,Port,HDMI,AC adapter,windows8,

Doing so will break the computer. Everything will run slow and give errors and do lots of weird stuff.

My last dell was the XPS 14 ultrabook and it was very good except I had some overheating problems, yet I had bought it as a ""refurbished"" from the Dell Outlet, knowing chances you take with such purchases. Like I said, other then that the XPS14 computer was very good, but I decided to sell it and try one more time with a Dell Product, even though I had it repaired by Dell...... The good news???? I purchased the Dell XPS 13 with the new 4th generation chip and had to have the backlit keyboard as from using that feature on the xps14. I also choose windows 7 because I do not like windows 8.

Inspiron 15,ecommerce Website,22/11/2013,4/5,"I recently purchased a new laptop, the Inspiron 15. I thought it would be a new version of my old Inspiron which needs percussive therapy every time we turn it on to get the screen to engage.
Silly me. Things are never the same. And why should they be when tweaks to hardware and software are available.
It seemed intuitive to me that I should order Windows 8. Isn't it obvious that it would be better than the previous version? Not. I hate that operating system. I wanted a computer not a large app device.
And it turns out the new computer is much heavier.
So after much hemming and hawing decided to return it. Well I was four days over the 30 return policy. Yes I know I should have checked that, but there was the whole holiday travel thing in there as well.
So alas, I have a heavy laptop with an obnoxious operating system that we don't want.",To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,,,

The other problem with it is the black trim around the keypad is trash. It keeps popping out of the locks that hold it in place.
Though not Dell's problem Windows 8 has frozen up on me several times and most of the problem there is because of IE 10. I hate it and use chrome now.
Overall the laptop so far is doing the basic job I need it for and that is to handle sales, inventory, and email. I would not recommend this for a power user or someone who wants to do heavy internet usage.

I got the i3-3227U version and this little bugger seems pretty nice for the price for me. I am liking the ribbed (haha - or whatever) material on the outside and the light weight. Seems pretty fast for just about everything I need - a little web development as well as common usage.
I am a casual gamer, but I am usually playing stuff about 3-5 years behind its release, and this thing is pretty much smoking for that. Fallout 3 is running nicely on high settings. The Intel HD 4000 card did not disappoint (for me as a behind-the-times gamer). And I have had it on my lap while playing and not gotten any lapburn or even felt much of a temperature rise
Gripes are that the keyboard will need some getting used to - the arrow keys are pretty small and home, delete, etc are also. My little touchpad looks like it has greasemarks on it already (I am not that greasy of a guy), but nbd!

The other is the fact that it doesn't come with recovery media. You can create your own, but it's still not the same as actually having the Windows 8 Pro OEM disk.

Our last Dell studio is still going strong, but I needed something with a little more punch for testing out component designs at home.
Laptop arrived in less than 2 days from order, which was better than expected. I opened it up and plugged in the power and away it went - no problems at all.
Windows 8 is a peculiar one at first, but I sat down and went through the instructions 'Getting Started with Windows 8 on your new Dell' that are provided. It's good that Dell had the forethought to include this and now I think Windows 8 is superb!
The keyboard is a pleasure to use and the keys soft but still definite in operation, with the annoying gaps between closed off, saving the inevitable collection of biscuit crumbs that cause malfunction. The separate keypad is a real bonus too.
Operating wise, it's fast to wake up, though I've yet to find a quick way to sleep - I'm sure it will be there somewhere and I just need to find it. It's nice and fast to open programs and not found anything it couldn't cope with doing.
The only thing I really don't like is that the plastic trim around the case just feels a little bit too cheap & nasty. Time over again, I'd pay a bit more and get the metal trimmed option, but the same spec 15R wasn't available until the end of Jan 2014.

Inspiron 15,ecommerce Website,19/11/2013,5/5,"I received my computer back in april and im really surprised by its performance. i have the i3 3rd gen. with 6gb of ram. its very responsive. i read other reviews, i have no clue what others are talking about, my computer boots up exceptionally quick. i do a lot of media editing, student work and i put the processor and graphics to the test. they are standing strong. im running programs very heavy on the processor such as ableton live and adobe photoshop and im not disappointed. if someone will tell you otherwise about this processor's abilities, theyre not the ""expert"" they're claiming to be.",To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,,,

Inspiron 15,ecommerce Website,19/11/2013,4/5,"First off, I want to say I have the ipad mini, iPad 2, the nook HD, and the kindle fire HD. All very impressive tablets. However, I've always wanted a tablet with enough power to run Windows 8. After weeks of research, I had my eye on the Sony Tap 11, Microsoft surface 2, Microsoft surface pro 2, Acer w4, and the Lenovo miix2. I've experimented with other tablets including the surfaces and found a strong interest in their performance but I couldn't agree with the prices and the strip down version of windows 8. Then I found this little gem. A tablet with powerful hardware, a full windows 8.1 os, and a price nearly impossible to beat. The reviews seemed to rate this tablet 4.5/5 I was convinced. After receiving the product, I fell in love with the performance as well as the speed, capabilities, and execution of the tablet. I stream all my files from my laptop which allows me to relax without carrying my laptop around. As for the Windows 8, in the beginning, I was never drawn to the OS because windows 7 was all I accepted. Yet, I truly feel that the windows 8 should remain existent to only touch base computers and tablets because the shortcuts you hate on windows 8 will be the things you appreciate using this tablet. I seriously recommend this tablet. Pros:full windows 8.1, full microsoft office 2013 student home, speed and touch sensitivity, great brightness at its resolution Cons:driver updates for cpu, sound is decent, may need stylus for desktop.",To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,,,
Inspiron 15,ecommerce Website,19/11/2013,4/5,"I am a technical professional 'veteran' (which just means old) of the semiconductor industry. I have long been searching for a single, very mobile device that allows to travel light, yet effectively be capable when needed. (my company is a MS based enterprise). I was pleasantly surprised with this device. I'll try and highlight my experience (I now have 2 :) one for the wife. Highlights- Screen - Excellent. Won't be redundant here with detail, Performance - Excellent, surprisingly so. I run full Office365, some SharePoint apps and an old version of Paperport. No lag at all. Extremely pleased.Connectivity - Excellent. The dual band WiFi has so far exceeded any other mobile device I've owned. One exception and this one of only 2 minor misses. Miracast for display is problematic(but works..with effort) Knew this going in, but a mini-HDMI would make this an amazing tool for a traveling professional. Input devices : This one disappointed me a bit. If you are looking for a similar stylus experience to the 'note' then this isn't for you if it's critical. Very 'marginal' for handwritten notes in 'OneNote'. Strokes are sensitive, but 'jittery'. I use it for the handwriting input panel in Win8.1 and works fine for this. No issues hooking up Bluetooth mouse and keyboard. Personal use : Excellent. NOTE: I would recommend only 64GB model! I made a mistake on my first one and ended up with 32GB (wife has this now) :) In my opinion, 32GB should not be sold. You max out the memory in a heart beat, especially if you're using business apps. Works excellent as media/reader/movies etc. 5GB 1080P MKV files with pass through DTS audio play flawless in VLC.I give value 5 for 5 despite the 2 minor misses as I consider those my 'quest for the ultimate portable' and it's hard to knock considering the price-point and value. If this device had a mini-HDMI so I could use to present PPT and a smoother stylus for hand-writing notes on par with wacomm...This would be the device I have always searched for. But hey, for the money amazing value/performance and quality. Nice Job Dell. Pros:screen, performance, mobility, battery, quality of build Cons:stylus - 'jittery' but sensitive, no mini-hdmi.",To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,To be derived,,,
